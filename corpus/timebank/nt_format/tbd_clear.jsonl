The financial assistance from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are not helping . In the last twenty four hours , the value of the Indonesian stock market has fallen by twelve percent. The Indonesian currency has lost twenty six percent of its value. In Singapore, stocks hit a five year low. In the Philippines, a four year low. And in Hong Kong, a three percent drop . More problems in Hong Kong for a place, for an economy, that many experts thought was once invincible . Here's ABC's Jim Laurie.\n    Not that long ago, before the Chinese takeover , the news about real estate here was that the sky was the limit the highest prices in the world. So when Wong Kwan spent seventy million dollars for this house, he thought it was a great deal . He sold the property to five buyers and said he'd double his money.\n    In Hong Kong, is always belongs to the seller's market. Now with new construction under way , three of his buyers have backed out. And Wong Kwan will be lucky to break even. All across Hong Kong, the property market has crashed . Pamela Pak owns eight condominiums here. Pak can't find buyers. She estimates her properties, worth a hundred thirty million dollars in October , are worth only half that now .\n    They believe ah it will be always up going up and up ah forever. Nobody believe this any more.\n    Of all of Asia's economies, Hong Kong is the most robust. But in the past three months , stocks have plunged , interest rates have soared and the downturn all across Asia means that people are not spending here.\n    Hotels are only thirty percent full. You can get seventy percent discounts at the shopping malls. Three thousand dollar pearls for eight hundred dollars. A two hundred dollar wool jacket for fifty dollars. Still, there are few buyers. And at the big brokerage houses, after ten years of boom , they're talking about layoffs .\n    I think that the mood is fairly gloomy , and I think it's not going to change for a couple of years .\n    So for Hong Kong, it's time , as investment bankers like to say, to reposition . To either hold on tight or get out, as much of Asia goes into recession .

People have predicted his demise so many times, and the US has tried to hasten it on several occasions. Time and again, he endures . He has outlasted and sometimes outsmarted eight American presidents. Fidel Castro invited John Paul to come for a reason. This is clearly an opportunity for Cuba to look good internationally.\n    The entire world will see images of the Pope in Cuba. They'll see images of the Pope with Fidel Castro. It will give the rest of the world the view that Cuba is like any other nation, something the US has, of course, tried to persuade the world that it is not . For nearly forty years , the United States has said categorically it would not tolerate totalitarian rule in its own backyard. It is the US economic and political embargo which has kept Cuba in a box.\n    The main positive for Castro to invite the Pope is international, to be able to say to the rest of the world, this government is not as closed , as intolerant , uh as totalitarian as some make it out to be.\n    One of the scenarios widely advanced before the visit is that through the Pope, Cuba, still led by Castro, can begin a more productive relationship with the world. That will, in turn, bring pressure on Washington to change .\n    Those observers looking for a battle between uncompromising representatives and very different ideologies will, in all likelihood, be disappointed .\n    Castro has said that you can be a Communist and still be a Christian. He says he and the Pope both want to end the exploitation of man by man. The question is who will Cubans believe ?\n    The main negative is the risk that the Pope's visit will persuade a great many more Cubans to break loose of the Cuban government. If so, then the Pope's visit would really open up a new chapter in the government's relations with its own society. For the Cuban government, that is the risk.\n    At the end of the broadcast this evening, one more trip around Havana to see what it's been like since the last time. And in just a moment Diane Sawyer will have some other news.","events":{"0":[23,23],"1":[25,25],"2":[33,33],"3":[35,35],"4":[44,44],"5":[48,48],"6":[51,51],"7":[57,57],"8":[61,61],"9":[83,83],"10":[91,91],"11":[101,101],"12":[108,108],"13":[112,112],"14":[122,122],"15":[124,124],"16":[141,141],"17":[146,146],"18":[148,148],"19":[160,160],"20":[163,163],"21":[165,165],"22":[177,177],"23":[184,184],"24":[186,186],"25":[198,198],"26":[201,201],"27":[205,205],"28":[208,208],"29":[221,221],"30":[224,224],"31":[232,232],"32":[236,236],"33":[240,240],"34":[248,248],"35":[253,253],"36":[260,260],"37":[263,263],"38":[276,276],"39":[296,296],"40":[302,302],"41":[304,304],"42":[306,306],"43":[317,317],"44":[327,327],"45":[331,331],"46":[333,333],"47":[340,340],"48":[351,351],"49":[354,354],"50":[362,362]},"event_order":{},"timex":{"0":[1,1],"1":[133,135]},"event_coreference":{"101":[108],"177":[57]}}

Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Eileen Collins will be named commander of the Space Shuttle Columbia for a mission in December . Colonel Collins has been the co-pilot before , but this time she's the boss . Here's\n    ABC's Ned Potter.\n    Even two hundred miles up in space, there has been a glass ceiling. It wasn't until twenty years after the first astronauts were chosen that NASA finally included six women, and they were all scientists, not pilots. No woman has actually been in charge of a mission until now .\n    Just the fact that we 're doing the job that we 're doing makes us role models . That was Eileen Collins, after she flew as the first ever co-pilot. Being commander is different. It means supervising the rest of the crew in training and leading them in flight. It is, in short, the kind of management job many American women say they've had to fight for. In space, some say female pilots were held up until now by the lack of piloting opportunities for them in the military. Once Colonel Collins was picked as a NASA astronaut , she followed a normal progression within NASA. Nobody hurried her up. No one held her back.\n    Many NASA watchers say female astronauts have become part of the agency's routine. But they still have catching up to do two hundred and thirty four Americans have flown in space, only twenty six of them women.\n    Ned Potter, ABC News.","events":{"0":[15,15],"1":[22,22],"2":[35,35],"3":[36,36],"4":[44,44],"5":[53,53],"6":[61,61],"7":[96,96],"8":[100,100],"9":[115,115],"10":[132,132],"11":[139,139],"12":[142,142],"13":[144,144],"14":[150,150],"15":[200,200],"16":[206,206],"17":[219,219],"18":[223,223],"19":[226,226],"20":[229,229],"21":[233,233],"22":[238,238],"23":[247,247],"24":[251,251],"25":[252,252],"26":[261,261],"27":[272,272]},"event_order":{},"timex":{"0":[1,1],"1":[12,12],"2":[46,46],"3":[57,58],"4":[89,90],"5":[121,121],"6":[203,203]},"event_coreference":{}}

President Bush on Tuesday said the United States may extend its naval quarantine to Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba to shut off Iraq's last unhindered trade route.\n    In another mediation effort, the Soviet Union said today it had sent an envoy to the Middle East on a series of stops to include Baghdad. Soviet officials also said Soviet women, children and invalids would be allowed to leave Iraq.\n    President Bush today denounced Saddam's ``ruinous policies of war,'' and said the United States is `` striking a blow for the principle that might does not make right.''\n    In a speech delivered at the Pentagon, Bush seemed to suggest that American forces could be in the gulf region for some time . ``No one should doubt our staying power or determination,'' he said .\n    The U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia continued at fever pace, with Syrian troops now part of a multinational force camped out in the desert to guard the Saudi kingdom from any new thrust by Iraq. In a letter to President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran, read by a broadcaster over Baghdad radio, Saddam said he will begin withdrawing troops from Iranian territory on Friday and release Iranian prisoners of war.\n    Iran said an Iraqi diplomatic delegation was en route to Tehran to deliver Saddam's message, which it said it would review ``with optimism.''\n    Saddam appeared to accept a border demarcation treaty he had rejected in peace talks following the August 1988 cease-fire of the eight-year war with Iran.\n    The move seemed aimed at heading off more trouble with Iran, which had condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 but also criticized the multinational force dispatched to Saudi Arabia.\n    Saddam said he sought to `` turn the gulf into a lake of peace free of foreign fleets and forces that harbor ill intentions against us.''\n    In other developments:\n    _The Pentagon said that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is considering urging Bush to order a national callup of armed forces reserves for active duty because of the drain on units sending soldiers abroad. Bush can call up to 200,000 reservists for up to 180 days without seeking congressional approval .\n    _Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said special ambassador Mikhail Sytenko left Tuesday for consultations with the governments of Syria, Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries. Sytenko, a former deputy secretary-general of the United Nations, is also expected to visit Baghdad, Gremitskikh said at a regular news briefing today .\n    _The outlook darkened for about 3,000 Americans caught in Iraq and Kuwait when Saddam sent his forces into the small, oil-rich sultanate.\n    The Iraqi ambassador to Greece said in Athens the Americans and other stranded foreigners could leave `` as soon as the threats from the United States and its allies are eliminated .'' ABC quoted an Iraqi Foreign Ministry official in Baghdad as saying Americans in Iraq are ``restrictees'' who will stay there until the crisis ends .\n    _The Soviet Foreign Ministry said Soviet women, children and invalids would be permitted to leave Iraq. Spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said the first group of 230 evacuees was assembling in Baghdad today , but evacuation plans were hampered by desert heat and lack of transportation.\n    Nearly 9,000 Soviets were among the hundreds of thousands of foreigners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait. Iraq has agreed to allow all 880 Soviets in Kuwait to leave , but only by a 1,200-mile road route through Iraq and to the Iraq-Jordan border.\n    _The British Foreign Office said today conditions in Kuwait appear to be deteriorating . There have been reports of wholesale looting but food and gasoline were still available , said a spokesman, who by custom was not identified . Banks remained closed .\n    _The Iraqi ambassador to Venezuela said on Tuesday that Iraq would retaliate against Venezuela and other OPEC oil cartel members if they boost oil production to fill the gap created by blocked supplies from Iraq and Kuwait. With Kuwait now `` annexed ,'' Iraq has control of 20 percent of the world's oil reserves. A steep rise in world oil prices followed the Kuwait invasion .\n    The U.N. Security Council on Aug. 6 ordered a global embargo on trade with Iraq as punishment for seizing Kuwait. Bush then sent U.S. troops and planes to Saudi Arabia, saying Iraqi troops massed nearby in Kuwait threatened Saudi Arabia and its vast oil reserves.\n    Twelve Arab League nations voted for an Arab force to protect Saudi Arabia, with the vanguard of Syria's contingent arriving Tuesday , according to diplomatic sources in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.\n    Egyptian and Moroccan troops are already there .\n    The predominantly Moslem nation of Bangladesh said today its troops would join multinational forces in Saudi Arabia. The size of the contingent was not disclosed .\n    Turkey and Saudi Arabia in effect shut down Iraq's major oil outlets through those countries, but according to Jordanian officials, a smaller line into Jordan remained operating .\n    Truckloads of goods rolled into Iraq from Jordan on Tuesday and Iraqi-bound cargo was unloaded from ships at the Red Sea port ofAqaba despite the U.N.-ordered sanctions .\n    King Hussein was reportedly carrying a message to Bush from Iraq's Saddam, with whom the king met Monday . The monarch will meet Bush on Thursday in Kennebunkport, Maine.\n    Crown Prince Hassan, King Hussein's brother and political adviser, was asked today about the message the king was said to be carrying . In an interview from Jordan on ABC, he declined to discuss details, but said : ``I don't think that his majesty would be traveling at this crucial moment if the Iraqi leadership did not have a rational approach to the future.''\n    A CBS News report citing unidentified Jordanian sources said that Saddam's message called for an international conference to be convened to discuss an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. In exchange , the buildup of U.S. forces in the region would halt . Bush, however, says he sees no short-term hope for a diplomatic solution to the gulf crisis _ at least until economic sanctions force Saddam to withdraw his army.\n    Bush held out the prospect of more aid to Jordan if it cooperates with the trade embargo .\n    On Tuesday , the United States and Soviet Union conferred in Washington on putting an anti-Iraq naval blockade under a United Nations umbrella.\n    The United States has provided most of the naval vessels so far to block Iraqi trade, with Britain, West Germany and Australia among the other nations lending support at sea.\n    The embargo is meant to cripple Iraq by cutting off its exports of oil and imports of food and military supplies. Iraq imports about three-quarters of its foodstuffs.\n    U.S. allies and other U.N. members have objected that the Security Council embargo resolution did not specifically authorize such a naval operation .\n    Bush told a news conference on Tuesday that the naval barricade now in force might be extended to Jordan's Aqaba `` if it is a hole through which commerce flows '' in and out of Iraq.\n    In Saudi Arabia, today is the eighth day of ``Desert Shield,'' the operation designed to confront an estimated 200,000 Iraqi soldiers now in Kuwait.

No pickup\n    LaserPhotos\n    By ROBERT DVORCHAK\n    Associated Press Writer\n    The Persian Gulf showdown between Iraq and the United States took a more personal turn Thursday when Iraq's Saddam Hussein called President Bush a liar and said the outbreak of holy war could bring thousands of Americans home in coffins.\n    Bush, commenting on the two-week -old gulf crisis from his vacation home in Maine, said he saw little reason to be optimistic about a settlement of the dispute , which stems from Iraq's invasion of oil-wealthy Kuwait and its subsequent military buildup on the border of Saudi Arabia. After a two-hour meeting at his Kennebunkport home with King Hussein of Jordan, Bush said , ``I did not come away with any feeling of hope '' that Iraq would withdraw its army from Kuwait.\n    Bush also said Thursday that King Hussein assured him Jordan would close the last remaining free port to most Iraqi trade as the economic embargo on materials to Iraq continued unabated . Foodstuffs are among the goods being blocked from entry ; Iraq imports about three-quarters of its food.\n    Pentagon sources in Washington meanwhile said the Bush administration plans to deploy 45,000 Marines to the region to back up the thousands of Army, Navy and Air Force troops already in place in the gulf and the Saudi desert.\n    At a news conference , Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Jordan `` is seeking some guidance '' about a provision in the U.N.-backed trade embargo that allows food for humanitarian purposes.\n    Worries however grew about the safety of Americans and other Westerners trapped in Kuwait. Iraqi military authorities ordered all Americans and Britons in Kuwait to assemble at a hotel, officials said .\n    ``Very few'' of the 2,500 Americans in occupied Kuwait complied with the order, a senior U.S. official told The Associated Press.\n    Iraq said the roundup was to protect them from unspecified threats ; British Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave called the order ``grave and sinister.''\n    ``What we fear is that they will be interned somewhere, most likely in Iraq,'' Waldegrave said .\n    A total of about 3,000 Americans, 3,000 Britons and more than 450 Japanese are in Iraq and Kuwait . Overall, more than 2 million foreigners are in both countries. Iraq has called them ``restrictees.''\n    In addition to the estimated 45,000 Marines to ultimately be part of Operation Desert Shield, Stealth fighter planes and the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy are also headed to Saudi Arabia to protect it from Iraqi expansionism .\n    In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Iraq has continued to increase its armed forces in Kuwait and they now number about 160,000.\n    Saddam has been under international quarantine since his Aug. 2 power-grab , or what he calls an ``eternal merger '' with Kuwait.\n    In a long verbal attack read on Iraqi television Thursday , Saddam repeatedly called Bush ``a liar '' and said a shooting war could produce body bags courtesy of Baghdad.\n    ``We continue to pray and pray hard to God so that there will be no confrontation whereby you will receive thousands of Americans wrapped in sad coffins after you had pushed them into a dark tunnel,'' Saddam said .\n    He called U.S. soldiers massing in Saudi Arabia the real occupiers in the Persian Gulf. Replied State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher, ``We have n't really analyzed the statement in detail but it appears to be just another example of his outlandish rhetoric and his attempts to distort the truth .\n    ``We believe that his words cannot distract the world from the facts of Iraqi aggression .''\n    An international land, sea and air force has mobilized since Iraq's invasion , which was sparked by disputes over oil, land and repayment of war loans.\n    In the largest U.S. military operation since Vietnam , an estimated 20,000 American GIs have already massed to defend Saudi Arabia.\n    ``We do n't just arrive ,'' said four-star Gen. John Dailey, assistant commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. ``We're there to stay for a fairly lengthy period .''\n    Egypt, Syria, Morocco and Bangladesh also committed ground troops, to a much lesser degree.\n    The U.S. Navy has 27 ships in the maritime barricade of Iraq. They are aided by Britain, West Germany, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium. Bush was expected to authorize naval commanders to use ``the minimum force necessary'' to interdict shipments to and from Iraq, a U.S. official said . That could include firing across the bow to halt a ship.\n    In the air, U.S. Air Force fliers say they have engaged in ``a little cat and mouse'' with Iraqi warplanes, which have retreated when weapons radar locks onto them. ``They do n't want to play with us,'' one U.S. crew chief said .\n    In Kuwait, the Iraqis have rimmed the capital city with an air-defense system, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He declined to say if the weapons included missiles, but the Iraqis have them in their arsenal. The Iraqis also possess chemical weapons.\n    The combined operations are designed to isolate and strangle Iraq until it retreats from Kuwait. The quarantine hopes to staunch the flow of Iraqi oil, which is Iraq's economic lifeblood, and clamp down on food and supplies going in.\n    Iraq now controls 20 percent of the world's oil reserves with its conquest of Kuwait. Only Saudi Arabia has more oil reserves.\n    The economic chokehold appears to be working.\n    The Lloyd's List International newspaper, which monitors worldwide shipping, said Iraq's fleet of 80 tankers and cargo ships has stopped regular trading .\n    John Prescott, a shipping correspondent, said there was no shipping in Kuwaiti or Iraqi ports and that activity was trailing off in the Jordanian port of Aqaba.\n    Bush's chief objective in his meeting with Hussein was to press the king to shut down Iraq's food and oil supply route from Aqaba on the Red Sea.\n    Aqaba is Iraq's only outlet now that an international noose has tightened . Bush has indicated the U.S. Navy will barricade the port from Iraqi ships. The president also has offered to help offset Jordan's costs because 40 percent of its exports go to Iraq and 90 percent of its oil comes from there.\n    ``It's our only outlet to the sea and the rest of the world,'' Hussein said . He also said of trade with Iraq: ``There are no shipments at the moment .'' A day earlier , scores of trucks, many with Iraqi license plates, streamed north out of Aqaba to Amman and onto the desert highway bound for Iraq.\n    The Jordanian monarch met this week with Saddam, but he told reporters he had no message from Baghdad. ``I am not talking on behalf of anyone in the area ... but myself,'' Hussein said .\n    In the United Nations, Libya called for the replacement of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf with Arab League forces and U.N. soldiers.\n    Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, in a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General, also called for an emergency Security Council meeting in Geneva to remove U.S. forces.

Treasurer Peter Costello, Environment Minister Robert Hill and Attorney General Daryl Williams all voted to support the republic Friday .\n    ``This convention will be seen as a turning point in our history,'' Australian Republican Movement spokeswoman Mary Delahunty said .\n    Pro-republicans hope to have an Australian president by the opening of the 2000 Olympics and the 100th anniversary of Australian federation. Calling for an amended constitution with a new preamble, to be written by Australian poets, republican Janet Holmes a Court said , ``We need the smell of eucalyptus in this, and the feel of red dust.''\n    Monarchists hope to defeat the republic at the referendum .\n    ``The phony war has finished and the real referendum campaign has clearly begun ,'' Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy executive director Kerry Jones said .\n    ``Well may we say `God save the Queen,' for nothing will save the republic,'' outraged monarchist delegate David Mitchell said .\n    ``The idea of a republic will fall to dust through the grace of almighty God.''\n    Polls have shown public support for a republic increasing , rising from about 35 percent several years ago to about 51 percent this year , as pro-monarchist sentiment diminishes .\n    Australia has been independent since 1901 , but like many Commonwealth nations it still recognizes the British monarch as its head of state.\n    Howard said Queen Elizabeth II is taking a great interest in the convention .\n    ``She is, I can assure you, from what I've been told , she's following the thing very closely and taking the view it's our business .\n    ``It's no secret that she's indicated to me ... she is a 20th century democrat, understands that the role of the crown in Australia rests in the hands of the Australian people as it has for almost a hundred years .'' The model for a republic, adopted over bitter objections from those advocating direct election of a president, is for presidential nominations to be made with public input and the winning candidate decided by a two-thirds majority of Parliament. Former prime minister Paul Keating, who put the republic issue in the spotlight in his unsuccessful 1996 campaign for re-election, welcomed the result . ``This is an important step along the path towards Australia claiming its full sovereignty, and due recognition that the monarchy can no longer serve us appropriately,'' Keating said.\n    (PROFILE\n    (WS SL:BC-Australia-Republic, 4th Ld-Writethru; CT:i;\n    (REG:EURO;)\n    (REG:BRIT;)\n    (REG:SCAN;)\n    (REG:MEST;)\n    (REG:AFRI;)\n    (REG:INDI;)\n    (REG:ENGL;)\n    (LANG:ENGLISH;))\n    )\n    AP-NY-02-13-98 1426EST","events":{"0":[102,102],"1":[118,118],"2":[122,122],"3":[140,140],"4":[142,142],"5":[144,144],"6":[148,148],"7":[154,154],"8":[166,166],"9":[167,167],"10":[177,177],"11":[178,178],"12":[184,184],"13":[186,186],"14":[189,189],"15":[195,195],"16":[199,199],"17":[208,208],"18":[218,218],"19":[222,222],"20":[228,228],"21":[240,240],"22":[242,242],"23":[260,260],"24":[262,262],"25":[274,274],"26":[288,288],"27":[294,294],"28":[296,296],"29":[302,302],"30":[314,314],"31":[317,317],"32":[325,325],"33":[334,334],"34":[337,337],"35":[354,354],"36":[356,356],"37":[361,361],"38":[368,368],"39":[370,370],"40":[375,375],"41":[378,378],"42":[389,389],"43":[397,397],"44":[405,405],"45":[413,413],"46":[424,424],"47":[426,426],"48":[438,438],"49":[440,440],"50":[444,444],"51":[446,446],"52":[449,449],"53":[456,456],"54":[464,464],"55":[472,472],"56":[483,483],"57":[496,496],"58":[501,501],"59":[507,507],"60":[516,516],"61":[522,522],"62":[525,525],"63":[527,527],"64":[531,531],"65":[536,536],"66":[546,546],"67":[556,556],"68":[565,565],"69":[575,575],"70":[587,587],"71":[590,590],"72":[593,593],"73":[626,626],"74":[637,637],"75":[640,640],"76":[642,642]},"timex":{"0":[6,7],"1":[106,107],"2":[120,120],"3":[149,150],"4":[265,265],"5":[305,305],"6":[451,453],"7":[458,459],"8":[474,474],"9":[577,580],"10":[636,636]},"event_coreference":{"446":[444],"527":[507],"642":[118]}}

Nhek Bunchhay, a loyalist of ousted Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, said in an interview with The Associated Press at his hilltop headquarters that he hopes to recover the remains of Christopher Howes within the next two weeks .\n    Howes had been working for the Britain-based Mines Advisory Group when he was abducted with his Cambodian interpreter Houn Hourth in March 1996 . There were many conflicting accounts of his fate .\n    Howes' team was clearing mines 17 kilometers (10 miles) from Angkor Wat, the fabled 11th century temple that is Cambodia's main tourist attraction, when it was attacked . In January this year , British police officers who had been searching for Howes concluded he had probably been killed soon after being captured .\n    The Foreign Office said it had informed the family of Howes, 37 years old when he was kidnapped , that he probably died within weeks or months of his capture on March 26, 1996 .\n    ``Obviously, it is deeply discouraging for the family after 22 months , but there is no proof of life . But there is no evidence in either direction _ that there is proof of life or death ,'' said a Foreign Office spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity. ``We will continue to do everything we can to establish what has happened .''\n    Thai military officials who monitor Cambodian affairs said privately Thursday that Britain, through its embassies in Thailand and Cambodia, has been pushing hard to resolve the Howes case as the second anniversary of his abduction nears.\n    Nhek Bunchhay, who had been closely involved in the search for Howes before having to flee the Cambodian capital after a coup d'etat last year , appeared confident he would find Howes' remains.\n    He said he received information from Khmer Rouge guerrillas on where the body had been buried , and recently ordered 10 of his men from a force of 500 near Khmer Rouge headquarters in Anlong Veng to conduct the search .\n    If and when the remains are found , he said , they would be turned over to the British Embassy, apparently meaning they would be sent across the border into Thailand and onward to Bangkok.\n    Nhek Bunchhay said he now believed Howes had been killed within a week of his capture by a Khmer Rouge faction loyal to Pol Pot, then the guerrilla group's leader. Pol Pot is considered responsible for the radical policies that led to the deaths of as many as 1.7 million Cambodians when the communist group held power in the late 1970s .\n    At the time Howes was captured , the Khmer Rouge were a more or less united guerrilla force with more than 10,000 men under arms. But the group began to fall apart in mid-1996 after the defection of one of its top leaders, Ieng Sary. Other commanders, and thousands of guerrillas, followed him.\n    A small hardcore group under Pol Pot continued to hold out at their headquarters at Anlong Veng in northern Cambodia near the Thai border.\n    But in June last year , the remaining leadership had a falling out, and Pol Pot was arrested . In July last year in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen staged a successful coup d'etat against First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Ranariddh's loyalists, including Nhek Bunchhay, his top military commander, went into hiding or fled the capital.\n    Nhek Bunchhay, evading an intensive manhunt , made his way to O'Smach, the last major outpost held by Ranariddh's forces. His men have held the stronghold _ which is on the border just opposite the Thai province of Surin _ against repeated intense attacks by Hun Sen's troops. They have been aided by Khmer Rouge guerrillas from Anlong Veng, who have formed an alliance with Ranariddh's resistance forces to oppose Hun Sen.\n    (PROFILE\n    (WS SL:BC-Cambodia-Britain-Hostage; CT:i;\n    (REG:ASIA;)\n    (REG:ENGL;)\n    (REG:EURO;)\n    (REG:BRIT;)\n    (REG:SCAN;)\n    (REG:MEST;)\n    (REG:AFRI;)\n    (REG:INDI;)\n    (LANG:ENGLISH;))\n    )\n    AP-NY-02-19-98 0802EST","events":{"0":[72,72],"1":[76,76],"2":[80,80],"3":[89,89],"4":[91,91],"5":[92,92],"6":[118,118],"7":[121,121],"8":[132,132],"9":[134,134],"10":[152,152],"11":[162,162],"12":[177,177],"13":[180,180],"14":[188,188],"15":[211,211],"16":[224,224],"17":[227,227],"18":[232,232],"19":[236,236],"20":[244,244],"21":[247,247],"22":[258,258],"23":[263,263],"24":[270,270],"25":[283,283],"26":[295,295],"27":[297,297],"28":[303,303],"29":[311,311],"30":[313,313],"31":[315,315],"32":[317,317],"33":[322,322],"34":[328,328],"35":[330,330],"36":[335,335],"37":[338,338],"38":[350,350],"39":[364,364],"40":[367,367],"41":[374,374],"42":[377,377],"43":[388,388],"44":[391,391],"45":[397,397],"46":[403,404],"47":[408,408],"48":[412,412],"49":[419,419],"50":[421,421],"51":[433,433],"52":[437,437],"53":[455,455],"54":[457,457],"55":[468,468],"56":[471,471],"57":[476,476],"58":[487,487],"59":[502,502],"60":[505,505],"61":[509,509],"62":[515,515],"63":[533,533],"64":[534,534],"65":[538,538],"66":[540,540],"67":[543,543],"68":[555,555],"69":[570,570],"70":[593,593],"71":[595,595],"72":[601,601],"73":[616,616],"74":[628,628],"75":[630,630],"76":[659,659],"77":[665,665],"78":[681,681],"79":[684,684],"80":[702,702],"81":[706,706],"82":[714,714],"83":[717,717],"84":[719,719],"85":[755,755],"86":[763,763],"87":[773,773]},"timex":{"0":[6,7],"1":[73,73],"2":[97,100],"3":[141,144],"4":[170,171],"5":[214,216],"6":[265,267],"7":[272,274],"8":[288,289],"9":[352,352],"10":[405,406],"11":[504,504],"12":[511,512],"13":[558,560],"14":[598,598],"15":[650,652],"16":[668,670]},"event_coreference":{"89":[162,236,258,270,377,515],"303":[311,295],"317":[322],"330":[328],"455":[457],"509":[232],"538":[540],"570":[515,377]}}

LR QL\n    UR (JT LR ) QL\n    UR By RICHARD W. STEVENSON LR QC QL\n    UR c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service LR QC QL\n    WASHINGTON _ The economy created jobs at a surprisingly robust pace in January , the government reported on Friday , evidence that America's economic stamina has withstood any disruptions caused so far by the financial tumult in Asia. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the economy added 358,000 jobs last month , far above the 235,000 forecast by economists.\n    It was the third consecutive month that job generation has been exceptionally strong. With growing opportunities for work drawing more people into the labor force, the unemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent last month , just a notch above its quarter-century low.\n    The demand for workers also led employers to raise wages again last month . Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees rose 4 cents, to $12.51. The gain left wages 3.8 percent higher than a year earlier , extending a trend that has given back to workers some of the earning power they lost to inflation in the last decade .\n    But economists said the wage increase was not enough to raise any concerns about higher inflation. And because the Federal Reserve has made clear that it expects the economy to slow in coming months as ripple effects from Asia reach the United States, investors disregarded the large jobs gains, betting that neither a rise in interest rates nor resurgent inflation is looming .\n    Stocks rose , pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 72.24 points, to 8,189.49, leaving the index within 70 points of its record high set on Aug. 6 . In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of inflation anxiety, prices edged up, pushing down the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to 5.92 percent from 5.93 percent.\n    ``Job creation is sturdy and we have effective price stability,'' said Paul McCulley, an economist at UBS Securities. ``The bottom line is that we've got a lovely economy.''\n    With potential inflation counterbalanced by worries about possible price declines , the Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, have suggested that they intend to keep interest rates unchanged until the economy tilts clearly in one direction or another.\n    The job figures for January extended a surge in employment gains that began last fall , just when the labor market had showed signs of cooling. After accounting for a small downward revision Friday to December 's figures, the economy has been creating jobs at a rate of 358,000 a month for the last four months _ and 381,000 over the last three months _ after averaging 242,000 for the first nine months of 1997 .\n    The surge in jobs reflects a remarkable confluence of positive and self-reinforcing economic forces. Inflation has been almost nonexistent, and consumer confidence has been extremely strong. After a short, sharp drop when Asia's financial problems first became clear, the stock market has rebounded and corporate profits have remained healthy. Long-term interest rates, an important indicator of economic stability, have fallen in the last few months . Lower rates have helped invigorate housing and other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy by making loans more affordable, and have allowed companies to continue investing heavily in more efficient equipment.\n    The likelihood that the federal budget will soon move from deficit into surplus has further improved the outlook. The less money the government needs to borrow, the more is freed for private investment.\n    President Clinton welcomed the job figures at a news conference Friday . His advisers said the results reflected not just from balancing the budget, but also initiatives like improved access to education and training and the opening of foreign markets to trade.\n    ``There are enormous economic and social benefits from our nation's high-employment economy,'' said Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. Some of the biggest employment gains came in the construction industry, which added 92,000 jobs in January . The increase reflected the strength of the housing industry, which has been helped not just by declining interest rates but also by unusually warm weather.\n    Service industries also showed solid job gains, as did manufacturers, two areas expected to be hardest hit when the effects of the Asian crisis hit the American economy. The major harm from Asia is likely to come from the plunge in the value of many Asian currencies relative to the dollar, a situation that is expected to lead to a surge of inexpensive imports into the United States, hurting American competitors. And the weakness of the Asian economies is also likely to lead to decreased demand for American exports.\n    ``The economy has been running on the fumes of the strength from before the Asia shock,'' McCulley said . ``Those fumes will exhaust themselves, and the manufacturing sector is going to start getting beat up in the spring.''\n    The figures showed the unemployment rate for adult men declined to 3.8 percent last month from 4.1 percent in December , the lowest figure for almost two decades. The rate for adult women rose 0.4 percent, to 4.4 percent.\n    For the first time, the Labor Department broke out unemployment by education level as well as gender, age and race. The analysis showed unemployment rates dropped steadily with higher levels of education. Among people with less than a high school education, the rate in January was 7.2 percent. Among high school graduates, the rate was 3.9 percent, and college graduates, 1.9 percent.\n    NYT-02-06-98 2219EST","events":{"0":[119,119],"1":[131,131],"2":[141,141],"3":[143,143],"4":[144,144],"5":[150,150],"6":[158,158],"7":[161,161],"8":[171,171],"9":[195,195],"10":[205,205],"11":[223,223],"12":[227,227],"13":[230,230],"14":[244,244],"15":[251,251],"16":[261,261],"17":[263,263],"18":[266,266],"19":[276,276],"20":[289,289],"21":[292,292],"22":[297,297],"23":[309,309],"24":[313,313],"25":[317,317],"26":[326,326],"27":[331,331],"28":[336,336],"29":[340,340],"30":[346,346],"31":[348,348],"32":[354,354],"33":[356,356],"34":[367,367],"35":[377,377],"36":[393,393],"37":[395,395],"38":[415,415],"39":[424,424],"40":[448,448],"41":[454,454],"42":[464,464],"43":[467,467],"44":[469,469],"45":[476,476],"46":[491,491],"47":[493,493],"48":[496,496],"49":[498,498],"50":[508,508],"51":[513,513],"52":[518,518],"53":[528,528],"54":[552,552],"55":[569,569],"56":[595,595],"57":[601,601],"58":[607,607],"59":[612,612],"60":[624,624],"61":[634,634],"62":[635,635],"63":[645,645],"64":[651,651],"65":[654,654],"66":[655,655],"67":[672,672],"68":[679,679],"69":[702,702],"70":[709,709],"71":[714,714],"72":[717,717],"73":[721,721],"74":[726,726],"75":[776,776],"76":[782,782],"77":[790,790],"78":[800,800],"79":[819,819],"80":[828,828],"81":[832,832],"82":[840,840],"83":[846,846],"84":[855,855],"85":[871,871],"86":[873,873],"87":[876,876],"88":[884,884],"89":[889,889],"90":[898,898],"91":[901,901],"92":[912,912],"93":[925,925],"94":[930,930],"95":[939,939],"96":[941,941],"97":[951,951],"98":[958,958],"99":[982,982],"100":[998,998],"101":[1013,1013],"102":[1016,1016],"103":[1033,1033]},"timex":{"0":[6,7],"1":[127,127],"2":[133,133],"3":[164,165],"4":[209,210],"5":[233,234],"6":[257,259],"7":[280,282],"8":[319,320],"9":[379,380],"10":[490,490],"11":[499,500],"12":[519,519],"13":[521,521],"14":[538,541],"15":[546,549],"16":[555,558],"17":[560,560],"18":[626,629],"19":[671,671],"20":[710,710],"21":[786,786],"22":[962,963],"23":[968,968],"24":[1035,1035]},"event_coreference":{"150":[144],"223":[227],"889":[898]}}

QL\n    UR By ANNA DOLGOV QC\n    UR Associated Press Writer QC\n    MOSCOW (AP) _ Presidents Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia signed an economic cooperation plan Friday , and Yeltsin claimed they resolved even more nagging problems.\n    Russia and Ukraine share similar cultures and languages, and Ukraine was ruled from Moscow for centuries . But while the two Slavic neighbors see themselves as natural partners, their relations since the breakup of the Soviet Union have been bedeviled by a number of disputes _ Black Sea naval bases, border problems and Ukraine's natural gas debts.\n    ``We have covered the entire list of questions and discussed how we will be tackling them,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``I must say there are no unsettled problems any more. We have solved them all.''\n    But his sweeping statement contained no details, and gave no indication of how the disputes could be resolved . Their solution would require a compromise between the two nations' parliaments.\n    A major dispute concerns a broad political treaty calling for border demarcation, which the two presidents signed last May .\n    In effect, the treaty amounts to Russian recognition of Ukraine's sovereignty and borders, and the Ukrainian parliament has already ratified it. However, Russia has stalled ratification , trying to tie it to an agreement that would permit the Russian navy to use a naval base on Ukraine's Crimean peninsula for at least 20 more years .\n    In their joint statement issued after the talks , Yeltsin and Kuchma called for the fastest possible ratification of the treaty, saying it would create a ``strong legal foundation'' for bilateral ties and help stability in Europe.\n    Kuchma assured Yeltsin that Ukraine would not join NATO, Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said , according to the Interfax news agency. The Russian leadership has staunchly opposed the western alliance's expansion into Eastern Europe.\n    In their joint statement, released by the Kremlin, the two leaders also pledged to consult each other regularly on their approaches to relations with NATO and, in particular, their action within the framework of NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Last year , Russian officials assailed Ukraine for holding joint naval exercises with NATO in the Black Sea _ an area Moscow considers its own turf.\n    Kuchma has said repeatedly that Ukraine would remain neutral for the foreseeable future.\n    Yeltsin and Kuchma also called for developing the stagnant relations between the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose coalition of former Soviet republics. In the past , Russia has often claimed that Ukraine was undermining efforts at closer cooperation within the CIS.\n    A major goal of Kuchma's four-day state visit was the signing of a 10-year economic program aimed at doubling the two nations' trade turnover, which fell to dlrs 14 billion last year , down dlrs 2.5 billion from 1996 .\n    The two presidents on Friday signed the plan, which calls for cooperation in the metallurgy, fuel, energy, aircraft building, missile, space and chemical industries. A major project is joint manufacturing of An-70 cargo planes, the Kremlin statement said .\n    The program also calls for coordination of economic reforms and joint improvement of social programs in the two countries, where many people have become impoverished during the chaotic post-Soviet transition to capitalism.\n    Kuchma also planned to visit Russian gas giant Gazprom, most likely to discuss Ukraine's dlrs 1.2 billion debt to the company.\n    (pvs/vi/ji)\n    (PROFILE\n    (WS SL:BC-Russia-Ukraine, 1st Ld-Writethru; CT:i;\n    (REG:EURO;)\n    (REG:BRIT;)\n    (REG:SCAN;)\n    (REG:MEST;)\n    (REG:AFRI;)\n    (REG:INDI;)\n    (REG:ENGL;)\n    (REG:ASIA;)\n    (LANG:ENGLISH;))\n    )\n    AP-NY-02-27-98 0817EST","events":{"0":[112,112],"1":[121,121],"2":[123,123],"3":[142,142],"4":[163,163],"5":[170,170],"6":[175,175],"7":[193,193],"8":[200,200],"9":[205,205],"10":[209,209],"11":[211,211],"12":[219,219],"13":[229,229],"14":[249,249],"15":[252,252],"16":[257,257],"17":[259,259],"18":[270,270],"19":[284,284],"20":[310,310],"21":[315,315],"22":[316,316],"23":[318,318],"24":[320,320],"25":[324,324],"26":[327,327],"27":[332,332],"28":[354,354],"29":[357,357],"30":[362,362],"31":[367,367],"32":[371,371],"33":[374,374],"34":[383,383],"35":[391,391],"36":[397,397],"37":[403,403],"38":[405,405],"39":[416,416],"40":[420,420],"41":[431,431],"42":[439,439],"43":[441,441],"44":[471,471],"45":[474,474],"46":[477,477],"47":[497,497],"48":[502,502],"49":[515,515],"50":[517,517],"51":[544,544],"52":[548,548],"53":[566,566],"54":[569,569],"55":[575,575],"56":[577,577],"57":[584,584],"58":[607,607],"59":[611,611],"60":[613,613],"61":[631,631],"62":[639,639],"63":[647,647],"64":[649,649],"65":[655,655],"66":[668,668],"67":[673,673],"68":[681,681],"69":[683,683],"70":[691,691]},"timex":{"0":[6,7],"1":[117,117],"2":[146,146],"3":[285,286],"4":[341,345],"5":[466,467],"6":[538,539],"7":[564,564],"8":[589,590],"9":[597,597],"10":[606,606]},"event_coreference":{"252":[175,249],"324":[327],"474":[477],"569":[607,112],"647":[611]}}

Citing an example, Sgt. Derek Glenn, a spokesman for the Newark Police Department, said that of nine women who had been killed last year , suspects had been arrested in only four cases . But over all, arrests were made in more than 60 percent of murder cases, he said . Eight of the 14 killings since 1993 were already under investigation by the Newark Police Department, Glenn said . Of the eight victims, three were stabbed , two were strangled , two were beaten to death and one was asphyxiated , he said , and these different methods of killing and other evidence seem to indicate that the eight cases are not related .\n    But with the task-force investigation just getting under way, officials have been careful not to draw any firm conclusions, leaving open the possibility of a serial killer in some of the cases. There have been no arrests in any of the slayings .\n    ``I have n't seen a pattern yet, '' said Patricia Hurt, the Essex County prosecutor, who created the task force on Tuesday . ``The type of lifestyle these women have is extremely dangerous,'' she said .\n    NYT-04-02-98 2252EST","events":{"0":[81,81],"1":[82,82],"2":[86,86],"3":[103,103],"4":[106,106],"5":[108,108],"6":[111,111],"7":[115,115],"8":[124,124],"9":[127,127],"10":[139,139],"11":[144,144],"12":[152,152],"13":[155,155],"14":[167,167],"15":[177,177],"16":[184,184],"17":[186,186],"18":[199,199],"19":[207,207],"20":[214,214],"21":[218,218],"22":[223,223],"23":[225,225],"24":[232,232],"25":[235,235],"26":[241,241],"27":[247,247],"28":[254,254],"29":[262,262],"30":[266,266],"31":[270,270],"32":[276,276],"33":[279,279],"34":[290,290],"35":[292,292],"36":[296,296],"37":[299,299],"38":[308,308],"39":[310,310],"40":[316,316],"41":[319,319],"42":[323,323],"43":[340,340],"44":[345,345],"45":[353,353],"46":[358,358],"47":[366,366],"48":[379,379],"49":[384,384]},"timex":{"0":[6,7],"1":[83,83],"2":[92,95],"3":[170,171],"4":[208,209],"5":[243,243],"6":[371,371]},"event_coreference":{"115":[86,345],"296":[241]}}

She took the stand for more than four hours Friday in a Tel Aviv magistrate's court.\n    Amir, 27, is serving a life sentence for the November 1995 assassination of Rabin at a Tel Aviv peace rally . Newspaper reports have said Amir was infatuated with Har-Shefi and may have been trying to impress her by killing the prime minister.\n    Har-Shefi acknowledged she told police interrogators that Rabin was a traitor and that she prayed for him to have a heart attack and die . She said Rabin's murder was ``a black stain on Israel,''Israel radio and Israel army radio reported .\n    Har-Shefi said she heard Amir talk about killing Rabin but did not tell the police because she did not believe he was serious .\n    Instead, she turned to her community rabbi in the Jewish West Bank settlement of Beit El and told him about Amir's statements . The rabbi said called the talk about killing Rabin `` nonsense ,'' and said Jews are prohibited from killing one another, the radio reports said .\n    Har-Shefi described Amir as an ``original thinker,'' as well as delusional and a liar. She also denied accusations made by Amir's brother, Hagai, that she joined an anti-Arab underground movement. She said she gave the Amir brothers false information regarding the location of a weapons and ammunition cache when they asked her to help organize such a movement.\n    (PROFILE\n    (WS SL:BC-Israel-Rabin; CT:i;\n    (REG:MEST;)\n    (REG:INDI;)\n    (REG:ENGL;)\n    (REG:AFRI;)\n    (REG:ASIA;)\n    (LANG:ENGLISH;))\n    )\n    AP-NY-02-27-98 0809EST","events":{"0":[63,63],"1":[76,76],"2":[80,80],"3":[81,81],"4":[86,86],"5":[88,88],"6":[91,91],"7":[100,100],"8":[103,103],"9":[106,106],"10":[108,108],"11":[111,111],"12":[113,113],"13":[116,116],"14":[137,137],"15":[145,145],"16":[153,153],"17":[158,158],"18":[161,161],"19":[168,168],"20":[170,170],"21":[173,173],"22":[181,181],"23":[183,183],"24":[190,190],"25":[194,194],"26":[201,201],"27":[203,203],"28":[206,206],"29":[208,208],"30":[220,220],"31":[226,226],"32":[228,228],"33":[230,230],"34":[232,232],"35":[237,237],"36":[244,244],"37":[247,247],"38":[254,254],"39":[269,269],"40":[273,273],"41":[277,277],"42":[278,278],"43":[280,280],"44":[282,282],"45":[285,285],"46":[288,288],"47":[291,291],"48":[299,299],"49":[305,305],"50":[320,320],"51":[321,321],"52":[322,322],"53":[329,329],"54":[335,335],"55":[337,337],"56":[354,354],"57":[357,357],"58":[358,358]},"timex":{"0":[6,7],"1":[77,77],"2":[120,123],"3":[124,124],"4":[143,144]},"event_coreference":{"116":[63],"208":[145],"220":[299],"280":[230],"282":[232],"288":[277],"321":[322]}}
