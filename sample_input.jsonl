{"id":"The Bear and the Travellers","text":"Two Travellers were on the road together, when a Bear suddenly appeared on the scene. Before he observed them, one made for a tree at the side of the road, and climbed into the branches and hid there. The other was not as nimble as his companion, and he threw himself on the ground and pretended to be dead. The Bear came up and sniffed all around him, but he kept perfectly still and held his breath: for they say that a bear will not touch a dead body. The Bear took him for a corpse, and went away.","events":{"0":[3,5],"1":[11,11],"2":[17,17],"3":[20,20],"4":[31,31],"5":[36,36],"6":[43,43],"7":[49,49],"8":[55,55],"9":[61,62],"10":[64,64],"11":[70,72],"12":[74,74],"13":[79,79],"14":[85,85],"15":[91,91],"16":[97,97]},"event_order":{"0":{"span":[0,6],"type":2,"time":"1:6","branch":"","factuality":""},"1":{"span":[8,14],"type":0,"time":"1","branch":"","factuality":""},"2":{"span":[16,18],"type":0,"time":"3.5","branch":"","factuality":""},"3":{"span":[19,37],"type":1,"time":"2","branch":"","factuality":""},"4":{"span":[38,46],"type":2,"time":":","branch":"","factuality":""},"5":{"span":[48,58],"type":1,"time":"2","branch":"","factuality":""},"6":{"span":[59,67],"type":1,"time":"4","branch":"","factuality":""},"7":{"span":[69,76],"type":0,"time":"5","branch":"","factuality":""},"8":{"span":[78,79],"type":2,"time":":","branch":"","factuality":""},"9":{"span":[81,88],"type":2,"time":":","branch":"","factuality":"@"},"10":{"span":[89,98],"type":1,"time":"6","branch":"","factuality":""}},"timex":{}}
{"id":"The Peasant and The Apple-Tree","text":"A peasant had in his garden an apple tree which bore no fruit but only served as a harbor for the sparrows and grasshoppers. He resolved to cut it down, and taking his axe in his hand, made a bold stroke at its roots. The grasshoppers and sparrows entreated him not to cut down the tree that sheltered them, but to spare it, and they would sing to him and lighten his labors. He paid no attention to their request, but gave the tree a second and a third blow with his axe. When he reached the hollow of the tree, he found a hive full of honey. Having tasted the honeycomb, he threw down his axe and, looking on the tree as sacred, took great care of it.","events":{"0":[2,2],"1":[10,10],"2":[15,15],"3":[25,25],"4":[31,31],"5":[37,37],"6":[48,48],"7":[57,57],"8":[66,66],"9":[70,70],"10":[74,74],"11":[81,81],"12":[95,95],"13":[102,102],"14":[109,109],"15":[113,113],"16":[118,118],"17":[124,124]},"event_order":{},"timex":{}}
